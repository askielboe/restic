Enhancement: Add adjustment for re-writing packs during prune

We've added the `--repack-threshold` flag to the `prune` command which
allows the user to specify the maximum percentage of unused space to
allow in a pack before prune will rewrite that pack. This gives the user
some control over the read/write activity occurs on the backend, which
is important for those backends with metered transactions.

Setting the value of this new flag to zero causes prune to re-write
packs with any amount of unused data (previous behavior). Setting the
value to 100 causes prune to only re-write packs that are completely
unused. The flag defaults to 20, which means that packs with less than
20% unused data are not re-written while packs with 20% or more
unused date are re-written.
